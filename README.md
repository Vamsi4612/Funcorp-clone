Project FunCorp
Hi Everyone, This is our first team project at Masai school.
Team member includes:-
⦁ Protyush Banerjee
⦁ Swapnil Kushwaha
⦁ Saurabh Vijay Sambharkar
⦁ Ansari Azaz Ahmad
⦁ Chaitali Dinesh Amale
⦁ Vamsi

This is our first project at Masai School using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. We worked on funcorp.in, an online Toys selling store.

We had a time frame of seven days. This was the first website building project for all of us, yes am emphasizing “website building” because we have built this website from scratch.

We tried to give our website some common functionality such as Carousel Sliding, Tab Switching, Dropdown Menu, Hover Effects, On-scroll shrinking, Categories pages, Brand pages, Character pages, Home pages, git-registry, Funlab , git-finder ,and Cart.

We have tried to build the exact Navigation bar as funcorp.in has with the On-scroll size shrinking and the drop-down menu on-hover, and many other functions. We have built the exact footer as it is on the original website.

This was our first project where we used JavaScript. Here we have GitHub repository link of our funcorp project :

My name is Swapnil kushwaha and this is my first team project with MASAI SCHOOL. I tried to use as many properties as possible and learned a lot of things from this project:-
1. I used HTML, CSS, JS, and Local-Storage ( to store and get data) and creative tags in JavaScript.
2. I used a lot of CSS properties to improve the user interface of the website.
3. I worked on the Login , LoginHome, Cart and Payment page. I got some issues in cart page but with the help of my team members I easily resolved that issue.
At last I would like to say that it was a very great experience in working on this project with my team members all the members were very supportive.
